                        ### Initializing a git repository
                        To initialize a git repository is to tell git to recognize the [working directory](#working-directory)
                        to be version controlled as a git repository

                        * `git init`
                        * `git init repo_path`

                    </section>

                    <section data-markdown>
                        ```bash
                        $ mkdir git_project # create git_project directory

                        $ cd git_project # move into git_project directory

                        $~/git_project: ls  # list all the files in directory

                        $~/git_project: pwd # present working directory
                        ~/git_project

                        $~/git_project: git init # tell git about this directory

                        $~/git_project: ls -a
                        .git                     #  where all the magic happens

                        ```

                    <section data-markdown>
                        ### Tracking a file

                        Whenever a new file is created, git does not know anything about this file, until you
                        tell it to start tracking this file.

                        * `git add`

                    </section>
                    <section data-markdown>
                        ```bash
                        $~/git_project: git status # state of the working tree
                        On branch master

                        ...

                        Untracked files:

                        ...

                        list of files not tracked

                        $~/git_project: git add file_name # start tracking this file
                        ```
                    </section>
                    <section data-markdown>
                        ```bash
                        $~/git_project: git status # state of the working tree
                        On branch master

                        No commits yet

                        Changes to be commited

                        new file: file_name  # staging area
                        ```
                    </section>

                    <section data-markdown>
                        ### [Commiting](#Commit) Changes
                        This have to do with telling git to send the tracked content in the staging area
                        to the [repository](#repository)

                        * `git commit`
                    </section>
                    <section data-markdown>
                        ```bash
                        $~/git_project: git commit --message="message to annoate this commit with"
                        [master (root-commit) ...] annotated message
                        file changed, insertion made
                        create mod 100644 file_name
                        ```

                        ### Commits logs
                        With git you can also view all your commits logs.
                        Commits logs shows you a detailed information about the commits you and other developers have made

                        * `git log`

                    </section>

                    <section data-markdown>
                        ```bash
                        $~/git_project: git log
                        commit sha1sum ( HEAD -> master )
                        Author: ...
                        Date: ...

                        commit message

                        ```
                    </section>

                    <section data-markdown>
                        ### Minimal Commit log
                        You can also tell git to show a minimal version of the `git log` output

                        ```bash
                        $~/git_project: git log --oneline
                        shorten sha1sum
                        ```

                        ```bash
                        $~/git_project: git log -3
                        ```
                    </section>

                    <section data-markdown>
                        ### Search the log base on some criteria
                        You can also search the commit log base on some criterias like

                        * Author Name
                        * Committer Name
                        * Date of Commit
                        * greping for contents
                        * e.t.c
                    </section>

                    <section data-markdown>
                        ### Searching by Authors Name

                        ### [Branch](#branch)
                        With branching you can create a different development path without messing up
                        your working directory or repo. Branching is normally used to test out things that might
                        work or might not work.

                        * `git branch`
                        * `git checkout -b`

                        ### Moving into new branches

                        To start working with the new branch you have to tell git to move away from the current branch
                        ( master ) to the newly created branch. Any changes made in the newly created branch won't show up
                        in the master branch. Moving into a new branch in git is called ***checkout***

                        Commits in new branch will not be visible to other branches

                        ```bash
                        $~/git_project: git add file_name
                        $~/git_project: git status
                        On branch my_branch

                        Changes not staged for commit:

                        ...
                        ...

                        modified: file_name

                        Two branches in a single repository can have different development path
                        the difference between this branches can be checked

                        * ` git diff `

                        In merging, git actually only copies commits not present in one branch
                        and apply's those commits into the current branch

                        * ` git merge `
                        * ` git rebase `
                        * ` git cherry-pick `

                        In situation wereby you no longer need a branch, it is advisable to delete the branch,
                        but you should make sure you have merged the commits made in that branch to a longelived branch

                        ```bash

                        the remote repo, they will be need for other collaborators to fetch those changes from the remote repo
                        to their own local repo

                        ```bash

                        If a remote branch is no longer needed, it is advisable you delete it, but you have to make sure
                        that all the commits in the remote repo is already fetched into the local repo

                        ```bash

                        ### Reseting Your Changes
                        Reset helps you to revert back to previous commits.
                        Resets can be of three types

                        `git reset`
                        
                        * soft  
                        * mixed
                        * hard
                        * merge
                        * keep
                    </section>
                    <section data-markdown>
                        ### Soft resets
                        Soft resets only moves the `HEAD` pointer to a previous commit.
                        * Staging area is not affected
                        * Working directory/tree is unaffected


                        ```bash
                        $~/git_project: git status
                        On branch master
                        ....

                        ### Mixed reset
                        It moves the HEAD pointer to a previous commit without affecting the working tree.
                        A mixed reset only affects the commited contents and the staging area. It affects the staging area
                        by unstaging all staged files

                        ```bash
                        $~/git_project: git status
                        On branch master
                        ...

                        files1.txt
                        files2.txt

                        ### Hard Reset
                        Hard reset changes your working tree, unstages your staged file, and moves your head pointer
                        to a previous commit. Uncommited changes in your working tree goes missing ( permanently )

                        Unstaging a content removes that content from the staging area, the content
                        will not be represented in any further committs untill it is added back to the staging area


                        ```bash
                        $~/git_project: git reset HEAD -- file_name

                        The content of a file can also be changed to represent what it was as of the last time
                        it was committed

                        ```bash

                        ### Reverting a Commit
                        Reverting a commit is actually carried out when you want to revert the changes a commit introduces
                        and it does that with a new commit message

                        * `git revert`

                        ```bash
                        $~/git_project: echo "First Commit" > file.txt
                        $~/git_project: git add file.txt
                        $~/git_project: git commit --message="First Commit"
                        $~/git_project: echo "Second Commit" > file.txt
                        $~/git_project: git add file.txt
                        $~/git_project: git commit --message="Second Commit"
                        $~/git_project: git log --oneline
                        sha1sum ( HEAD -> master ) Second Commit
                        sha1sum First Commit
                        $~/git_project: git revert HEAD

                        Reflog records all changes that occur in a branch. With reflog it is easy
                        to undo an action

                        * `git reflog`

                        and make a local copy of the repository on your machine

                        * `git clone https://repository_url`
